# Cloud Migration Plan – BNY Mellon

## 1. Company's motivators of migration to the cloud
BNY Mellon moved some of its systems to Microsoft Azure because:  
- Sometimes they get a lot of payments at the same time like in the COVID time, and they need extra space to handle all of them.  
- They don’t want to buy a lot of new servers as it can be expensive also.  
- The bank must always be working so customers trust them.  
- The cloud is the imporatnt virtual space that will help them try new things in the future, like latest smart tools and AI.

## 2. Questions to understand the company infrastructure?
- How many payment happened everyday? What’s the peak busy time?  
- Which systems can't stop working?  
- How do they keep all th data safe?  
- What computers and programs do they use now?  
- How do their customers connect to the system?  
- What happens if a system fails? Is that will be recoverable and if so how fast can it recover?

## 4. Migration approach that will suit the company.
Start small with one part of the system in the cloud. Keep the old system working at the same time. If it works well, move more parts step by step.  

## 5. High level schedule for the migration process
- Week 1–2:Look at current system and risks.  
- Week 3–6:Plan the cloud setup and security.  
- Week 7–10:Try a small test in Azure.  
- Week 11–16:Move first parts and check everything.  
- Week 17–20:Move main parts.  
- Week 21–24:Final checks and support.

## 6. Main decision criteria for the company
- System must be safe and follow rules.  
- Customers should not notice any problems.  
- Cloud must work with old systems.  
- Support from Microsoft.
